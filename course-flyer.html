<p>=========================================== 2 week gap ===========================================</p>
<h2>Lesson #8 (Final Project Showcase):</h2>
<p>In this class, we will give everyone a chance to show off their final project. We will expect every student to have 5
    minutes to present their websites (final project), explain what web technologies they used, and share interesting
    features with other students.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva, sans-serif;">Hello, My name is Jerry, a 10h
            grade high school student. Among the 2 years there, I became the top programmer at the school robotics team
            for FRC, I am participating in the school coding club, and am preparing for the AP computer science class. I
            also won awards in Math competitions like the AMC and Mathcounts, being in the top 5% in AMC 8. During the
            summer time of COVID, I was enrolled in a summer program to learn algorithms for big data and machine
            learning with a CMU professor. In my freetime, I like to run and play tennis, and of course experiment with
            web technologies. </span></p>
